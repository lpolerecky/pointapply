abstract = {Consistency of $\delta$13C measurements can be improved 39-47{\%} by anchoring the $\delta$13C scale with two isotopic reference materials differing substantially in 13C/12C. It is recommended that $\delta$13C values of both organic and inorganic materials be measured and expressed relative to VPDB (Vienna Peedee belemnite) on a scale normalized by assigning consensus values of -46.6‰ to L-SVEC lithium carbonate and +1.95‰ to NBS 19 calcium carbonate. Uncertainties of other reference material values on this scale are improved by factors up to two or more, and the values of some have been notably shifted: the $\delta$ 13C of NBS 22 oil is -30.03‰. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We describe an open-source freeware programme for high throughput analysis of nanoSIMS (nanometre-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry) data. The programme implements basic data processing and analytical functions, including display and drift-corrected accumulation of scanned planes, interactive and semi-automated definition of regions of interest (ROIs), and export of the ROIs' elemental and isotopic composition in graphical and text-based formats. Additionally, the programme offers new functions that were custom-designed to address the needs of environmental microbiologists. Specifically, it allows manual and automated classification of ROIs based on the information that is derived either from the nanoSIMS dataset itself (e.g. from labelling achieved by halogen in situ hybridization) or is provided externally (e.g. as a fluorescence in situ hybridization image). Moreover, by implementing post-processing routines coupled to built-in statistical tools, the programme allows rapid synthesis and comparative analysis of results from many different datasets. After validation of the programme, we illustrate how these new processing and analytical functions increase flexibility, efficiency and depth of the nanoSIMS data analysis. Through its custom-made and open-source design, the programme provides an efficient, reliable and easily expandable tool that can help a growing community of environmental microbiologists and researchers from other disciplines process and analyse their nanoSIMS data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We propose that authigenic carbonate, produced in sediment pore fluids during early diagenesis, has played a major role in the carbon cycle in the past. This sink constitutes a minor component of the carbon isotope mass balance under the modern, high levels of atmospheric oxygen but was much larger in times of low atmospheric O(2) or widespread marine anoxia. Waxing and waning of a global authigenic carbonate sink helps to explain extreme carbon isotope variations in the Proterozoic, Paleozoic, and Triassic.},

abstract = {The approach to diagenesis in this book is unorthodox in that it is entirely on the third level. This means that diagenesis is described quantitatively in terms of mathematical rate expression. Our goals will be to develop theoretical models, based on a combination of sediment observations and a priori reasoning, which describe and interrelate in a quantitative manner the various diagenetic processes that affect a given sediment property during early diagensis. Although many important diagenetic problems will be addressed, it is not our purpose to discuss each mineral type, sediment type, etc., in terms of natural observations and thermodynamic equilibrium (levels one and two). The topics covered in the last three chapters are chosen merely to illustrate the power of the mathematical models developed in the previous three chapters and not to provide a survey either of diagenetic processes or of the products of these processes. Thus, the scope of the book is narrow but very deep. This is done partly out of necessity because much of the rate data upon which diagenetic models must rest has not yet been obtained.

@article{Lin2016,
abstract = {Abstract Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO4-AOM) in marine sediments commonly leads to the precipitation of pyrite. It is, however, frequently challenging to unequivocally unravel the entire history of pyritization, because of the common coexistence of SO4-AOM derived pyrite with pyrite resulting from organiclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). To better understand how SO4-AOM affects pyritization in methane-bearing sediments and how this can be identified, we applied secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze the sulfur isotope composition ($\delta$34S) of authigenic pyrite in addition to sulfur isotope measurements of bulk sulfide and hand-picked pyrite aggregates from the two seafloor sites, HS148 and HS217, in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Authigenic, mostly tubular pyrite aggregates from these sites consist of three types of pyrite: framboids, zoned aggregates with radial overgrowths surrounding a framboidal core, and euhedral pyrite crystals. Framboids with low SIMS $\delta$34S values (as low as − 41.6‰ at HS148, and − 38.8‰ at HS217) are dispersed throughout the cores, but are especially abundant in the shallow part of the sedimentary column (i.e. above 483 cmbsf in HS148; above 670 cmbsf in HS217). These patterns are interpreted to reflect the dominance of OSR during early diagenetic processes in the shallow sediments. With increasing depth, both $\delta$34S values of bulk sulfide minerals and hand-picked pyrite aggregates increase sharply at 483 cmbsf in core HS148, and at 700 cmbsf in core HS217, respectively. Radial pyrite overgrowths and euhedral crystals become abundant at depth typified by high $\delta$34S values for hand-picked pyrite. Moreover, SIMS analysis reveals an extreme variability of $\delta$34S values for the three pyrite types on a small scale in these zones. Besides some moderately 34S enriched framboids, most of the overgrowths and euhedral crystals display extremely high SIMS $\delta$34S values (as high as + 114.8‰ at HS148, and + 74.3‰ at HS217), representing the heaviest stable sulfur isotope composition of pyrite ever reported to the best of our knowledge. Such an abrupt and extreme increase in $\delta$34Spyrite values with depth is best explained by an enrichment of 34S in the pool of dissolved sulfide caused by SO4-AOM in the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The increase in $\delta$34S values from framboidal cores to overgrowth layers and euhedral crystals indicates continuous, and finally near to complete exhaustion of dissolved sulfate at the SMTZ following a Rayleigh distillation process. SO4-AOM allowed for subsequent growth of later stage pyrite over the initial framboids, part of which formed earlier and at shallower depth by OSR. The combination of a detailed petrographic study of authigenic pyrite with SIMS analysis of stable sulfur isotopes in organic-rich strata proves to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the dynamics of sulfur cycling in modern and, potentially, ancient sedimentary sequences.},

abstract = {Nitrogen compounds in the interbedded turbiditic/pelagic sediments of the Madeira Abyssal Plain (from hereon MAP) have been divided in separate extracted fractions such as 'exchangeable nitrogen' (N(ex)), 'fixed nitrogen' (N(fix)) and 'organic nitrogen' (N(org)). N(ex) is found to be directly proportional to the amount of organic matter (C(org)) in the sediment and is not related to the amount of ammonium in the porewater. Only at a relatively low C(org) content is the N(ex) determined by the mineralogy of the sediment. The N(org) as determined from N(org) = (N(tot) - N(fix) - N(ex)) is strongly related with C(org). The N(fix) content and the N(fix)/Al ratio for organic-rich sediments are high compared with other sediments and have not changed upon post-depositional oxidation of the organic matter. Post-depositional oxidation of organic matter through oxygen does lead to a decrease in the C/N ratio of the remaining organic matter in the organic-rich turbidites. The C/N ratio calculated for the organic matter that has been decomposed through oxygen is similar to that calculated through stoichiometric modelling for decomposition under reducing circumstances (C/N ratios of almost-equal-to 17 and almost-equal-to 18, respectively). This implies that for the sediments of the MAP, the C/N ratio is identical for organic matter decomposed under oxygenated and under reducing conditions.},

Within a single foraminiferal test from a core top sample comprising both ontogenetic calcite and outer crust, $\delta$18O values vary from 0.5‰ to 3.7‰ [PDB], exceeding the range of equilibrium $\delta$18O in the specimens' habitat by a factor of three. The isotopic difference between the ontogenetic calcite and the crust averages 1.8‰. Neither of the two types of foraminiferal calcite precipitates in equilibrium with ambient seawater. The ontogenetic calcite exhibits a negative vital effect $\Delta$18O(M-E) ($\delta$18O(measured) - $\delta$18O(equilibrium)) ranging from - 0.5 to - 1‰. The largest negative fractionation is associated to the inner walls of juvenile chambers. In contrast, a positive vital effect of about 0.8‰ was observed in the crust with respect to the highest equilibrium $\delta$18O values at water depths below 200 m. Hence two vital effects that are opposite in sign are effective within a single foraminiferal test, indicating that 'whole test' values of this species are highly sensitive to the degree of encrustation and amplify or attenuate environmental signals. The negative vital effect of the ontogenetic calcite was verified by ion microprobe analysis of four nonencrusted net-sampled specimens reflecting three different depth intervals. Intra-ontogenetic oxygen isotope ratios in these juvenile tests range from 0.6 to 3.0‰ and exhibit a negative vital effect even larger than that observed in core top samples. Based on these data, the large range of 'apparent' vital effects reported for this foraminiferal species can be assessed by a mass balance calculation, assuming that the degree of encrustation is variable. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Despite the significant improvement on spatial resolution, NanoSIMS still preserves relatively high mass resolution, sensitivity, and analytical precision. It has become an important analytical platform to determine chemical compositions of solid materials, and has been widely used in space, earth, life, and materials sciences, etc. By using a Cs+ ion beam with a size as small as 50 nm scanning over sample surfaces, we are able to obtain high spatial resolution images of up to 7 species simultaneously. When utilizing Faraday cup, high analytical precision of 0.3‰–0.5‰ (1SD) for C, O and S isotopic analysis can be achieved. Although this precision level is still lower than that of conventional SIMS, it already meets the major requirements of Earth Sciences. In 2011, the first NanoSIMS of China (Cameca NanoSIMS 50L) was installed at Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the working mechanism and analytical modes of the instrument, this paper will systematically introduce the analytical methods established with the NanoSIMS and their potential applications in earth sciences. These methods include trace element distribution images in mineral zoning, high spatial resolution (2–5 $\mu$m) Pb-Pb and U-Pb dating, water content and H isotopic analysis for silicate glass and apatite, C isotopic analysis for diamond and graphite, O isotopic analysis for carbonate, S isotopic analysis for sulfides. In addition, the specific requirements for sample preparation will also be introduced in order to facilitate domestic earth scientists' use.},

Quite a bit is known in such situations too, but knowledge is scattered across the literature and considerably less well known among practitioners. Motivated from simple but generic examples, we show there is quite a market for asymptotic one-sided hypothesis tests, in the scalar as well as in the vector case. Reassuringly, the three standard tests can be used here as well and are asymptotically equivalent, but a somewhat more elaborate version of the score and Wald test statistics is needed. Null distributions take the form of mixtures of $\chi$2 distributions.

In this time ca. 1200 publications appeared containing analytical data on reference materials, indicating that their importance for analytical work has been recognised by geochemists and environmental scientists. Although many reference materials exist, there remains a pressing need for further samples, especially for certified rock reference materials, homogeneous reference glasses, mineral reference materials and so-called delta-zero materials for normalisation purposes of stable isotopes. This review focuses on six topics: rock reference materials, reference materials for platinum-group elements, reference glasses, mineral reference materials, environmental reference materials (seawater, soil) and isotopic reference materials (radiogenic, stable isotopes). In addition, a short description is given of the GeoReM database for reference materials of geological and environmental interest, which contains analytical data from the publications discussed in this review. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.

abstract = {Analytical precision is vital in the interpretation of stable isotope data collected by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) given the small analysis volumes and the small magnitude of natural isotopic variations. The observed precision of a set of measurements is represented by the standard deviation(precision of an individual measurement) or the standard error of the mean (precision of the mean value). The SIMS data show both systematic variations with time and rando m Poisson variability, but the former largely cancel out when data for two different isotopes are expressed as a ratio. The precision of a SIMS isotope ratio routinely matches that predicted by Poisson counting statistics and can approach that of conventional bulk analysis techniques for counting times of several hours. All sample analyse must be calibrated for instrumental mass fractionation using SIMS analyses of a standard material. There is often a gradual drift in the mass fractionation with time, but this can be modelled by least-squares regression of the standard isotope ratios. Drift in the sample analyses is eliminated by using the relevant point on this regression line to calibrate each sample. The final precision of a corrected isotope ratio must take into account the scatter in both the sample and the standard data.},

abstract = {Ion microprobe analysis of magnetites from the Adirondack Mountains, NY, yields oxygen isotope ratios with spatial resolution of 2-8 $\mu$m and precision in the range of 1‰ (1 sigma). These analyses represent 11 orders of magnitude reduction in sample size compared to conventional analyses on this material and they are the first report of routinely reproducible precision in the 1 per mil range for analysis of $\delta$18O at this scale. High precision micro-analyses of this sort will permit wide-ranging new applications in stable isotope geochemistry. The analyzed magnetites form nearly spherical grains in a calcite matrix with diopside and monticellite. Textures are characteristic of granulite facies marbles and show no evidence for retrograde recrystallization of magnetite. Magnetites are near to Fe3O4 in composition, and optically and chemically homogeneous. A combination of ion probe plus conventional BrF5 analysis shows that individual grains are homogeneous with $\delta$18O=8.9±1‰ SMOW from the core to near the rim of 0.1-1.2 mm diameter grains. Depth profiling into crystal growth faces of magnetites shows that rims are 9‰ depleted in $\delta$18O. These low $\delta$18O values increase in smooth gradients across the outer 10 $\mu$m of magnetite rims in contact with calcite. These are the sharpest intracrystalline gradients measured to date in geological materials. This discovery is confirmed by bulk analysis of 150-350 $\mu$m diameter magnetites which average 1.2‰ lower in $\delta$18O than coarse magnetites due to low $\delta$18O rims. Conventional analysis of coexisting calcite yields °18O=18.19, suggesting that bulk $\Delta$18O (Cc-Mt)=9.3‰ and yielding an apparent equilibration "temperature" of 525° C, over 200° C below the temperature of regional metamorphism. Consideration of experimental diffusion data and grain size distribution for magnetite and calcite suggests two contrasting cooling histories. The data for oxygen in calcite under hydrothermal conditions at high P(H2O) indicates that diffusion is faster in magnetite and modelling of the low $\delta$18O rims on magnetite would suggest that the Adirondacks experienced slow cooling after Grenville metamorphism, followed by a brief period of rapid cooling, possibly related to uplift. Conversely, the data for calcite at low P(H2O) show slower oxygen diffusion than in magnetite. Modelling based on these data is consistent with geochronology that shows slow cooling through the blocking temperature of both minerals, suggesting that the low $\delta$18O rims form by exchange with late, low temperature fluids similar to those that infiltrated the rock to serpentinize monticellite and which infiltrated adjacent anorthosite to form late calcite veinlets. In either case, the ion microprobe results indicate that two distinct events are recorded in the post-metamorphic exchange history of these magnetites. Recognition of these events is only possible through microanalysis and has important implications for geothermometry. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {We propose a method for quantifying the in situ heterogeneity of solid materials at the picogram test portion scale, illustrating its use by investigating the oxygen isotope ratio (18O−/16O−) of four quartz samples. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry, we could estimate the intrinsic heterogeneity using a large number ({\~{}} 100) of closely spaced duplicated measurements. An analysis of variance was then applied to these large data sets to extract the measurement repeatability (typically 0.10–0.15‰, 1s) from the total variability, thereby revealing a variability ranging from 0.18‰ to 2.3‰, which can be attributed to the genuine isotope ratio heterogeneities. A small proportion of outlying values were either rejected manually after inspection, or were accommodated using robust statistics. We also evaluated two distinct approaches for estimating and correcting instrumental drift; the use of a sub-area of the test material (if shown to have sufficiently low heterogeneity) is judged to be preferable to using a piece of unrelated silicate glass that we believe to be homogeneous. We also compared three approaches for estimating measurement repeatability, from which we show that the ‘duplicate method' applied to the reference material is preferable to using other methods based either on the drift monitoring material or on assessing residuals of the drift monitoring material after drift correction. Finally, here we propose a strategy for predicting the number of measurements on individual fragments of a material that would be required to achieve a specified target uncertainty.},

abstract = {New records of the abundance of C-13 in marine organic matter have been compiled for (i) the later Neoproterozoic, from 800 to 543 Ma (346 analyses), (ii) the Cambrian through the Jurassic (1616 analyses), and (iii) the Cretaceous and Cenozoic (2493 analyses). Comparison of these to existing compilations of the abundance of C-13 in sedimentary carbonates has allowed development of a record of the isotopic fractionation (= epsilon(TOC)) accompanying the production and burial of organic material. Over time, globally averaged values of epsilon(TOC) have fallen in three ranges: (i) greater than 32 parts per thousand and apparently indicative of significant inputs from sulfide-oxidizing or other chemoautotrophic bacteria, notably during late Proterozoic interglacials at 752, 740-732, and 623-600 Ma; (ii) between 28 and 32 parts per thousand and indicative of maximal fractionation of carbon isotopes by phytoplanktonic producers, during the Neoproterozoic from 800 to 750 and from 685 to 625 Ma and during the Phanerozoic up to the early Oligocene; and (iii) less than 28 parts per thousand, probably reflecting a reduction of primary fractionation by some combination of low levels of CO2, rapid rates of growth, and high ratios of cellular volume to surface area during Neoproterozoic glaciations (740, 720, and 575 Ma) and since the early Oligocene. Evidence of similar variations during the Ordovician and Gondwanan glaciations is absent. The decline in epsilon(TOC) since the early Oligocene, from 30 to 22 parts per thousand, has been nearly linear. The structure of the record of epsilon(TOC) suggests that the maximal isotopic fractionation between dissolved CO2 and primary biomass has consistently been 25 parts per thousand. Overall, the records provide compelling evidence that values of epsilon(TOC) have varied widely and that the long-term average fractionation is roughly 30 parts per thousand.

abstract = {The metabolic activities of microbial mats have likely regulated biogeochemical cycling over most of Earth's history. However, the relationship between metabolic activity and the establishment of isotopic geochemical gradients in these mats remains poorly constrained. Here we present a parallel microgeochemical and microbiological study of micron-scale sulfur cycling within hypersaline microbial mats from Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Dissolved sulfide within the mats was captured on silver discs and analyzed for its abundance and delta(34)S isotopic composition using high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). These results were compared to sulfide and oxygen microelectrode profiles. Two-dimensional microgeochemical mapping revealed well-defined laminations in sulfide concentration (on scales from 1 to 200 microm), trending toward increased sulfide concentrations at depth. Sulfide delta(34)S decreased from approximately +10 per thousand to -20 per thousand in the uppermost 3 mm and oscillated repeatedly between -10 per thousand and -30 per thousand down to a depth of 8 mm. These variations are attributed to spatially variable bacterial sulfate reduction within the mat. A parallel examination of the spatial distribution of known sulfate-reducing bacteria within the family Desulfobacteraceae was conducted using catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. Significant concentrations of Desulfobacteraceae were observed in both oxic and anoxic zones of the mat and occurred in several distinct layers, in large aggregates and heterogeneously dispersed as single cells throughout. The spatial distribution of these microorganisms is consistent with the variation in sulfide concentration and isotopic composition we observed. The parallel application of the methodologies developed here can shed light on micron-scale sulfur cycling within microbially dominated sedimentary environments.},

This chapter intends to answer this question in a positive sense and helps to analyze forms and contents of such political dimension in Western countries. The main thesis is that an “implicit smart politics” exists. This type of politics is often not identifiable as such, not subjected to a real process of political institutionalization, and strongly diffused among the various social actors. Moreover, we affirm that the ‘implicit' character of the smart politics is intertwined with the great changes of modern politics caused by the processes of globalization and by the transformations of the role and meaning of the modern state. Thereafter, this chapter discusses the central risks of the implicit smart politics, whose lack of institutionalization in genuinely democratic political forums may favor the excessive power of economic-financial and technological actors. In the final analysis, we argue for an overall political vision and a long-term political project, which guarantees the recognition and limitability of power and defines the forms of political and democratic participation.},

abstract = {Advances in analytical techniques are fundamental to the enhanced understandings of many geological processes. Zoned volcanic crystals have been analysed by low (5) kV field emission gun electron probe micro-analyser (FEG-EPMA) and NanoSIMS to obtain sub-micrometre chemical profiles and compared to time-of-flight SIMS (TOF-SIMS) and high (15-20) kV EPMA profiles. Plagioclase and orthopyroxene crystals have been analysed by FEG-EPMA, at accelerating voltages of 5. kV providing a spatial resolution (step size) of ≤ 350 nm (the resolution of the lowest energy X-ray) for orthopyroxene crystals using a 30 nm beam and ca. 750. nm for plagioclase crystals which at low voltages are unstable and require a 500. nm defocused beam. Step sizes are comparable in size to interaction volumes. Analytical protocols are detailed that permit quantitative major and minor element compositions to be acquired at similar precision and accuracy as traditional EPMA analyses at 15-20. kV. NanoSIMS analysis of the same crystals provides a greater spatial resolution of up to 200. nm and allows the measurement of Li also. The NanoSIMS profiles, however, cannot currently be quantified. The ability to analyse crystals at sub-micrometre scales is demonstrated by the good agreement between NanoSIMS, FEG-EPMA, conventional EPMA and TOF-SIMS data. FEG-EPMA, NanoSIMS and TOF-SIMS techniques have broad applications within the earth sciences. In petrologic studies for example, these methods have the ability to analyse small crystals in experimental charges and provide chemical profiles of crystal zoning at a spatial resolution of ca. 200-300. nm. Such profiles are important in crystal forensics and diffusion chronometry studies. The implications for the latter application are that timescales of volcanic processes that occur in the days-years immediately prior to the eruption can now be studied. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We have used a variety of complementary microanalytical techniques to constrain the mineralogy, trace-element distributions, and oxygen-isotopic compositions in a 50 × 50 $\mu$m area of Acfer 094 matrix. The results reveal the exceptional mineralogical and compositional heterogeneity of this material at the sub-$\mu$m level. We observe $\mu$m-scale and sub-$\mu$m grains with elemental associations suggesting feldspar, metal with widely varying Ni contents, and a Cr-Fe alloy (in addition to forsterite, pyroxene, sulfide, ferrihydrite, and amorphous groundmass previously described). A new class of $\mu$mscale CAI ($\mu$CAI) is also observed, which show sub-$\mu$ compositional zoning, and a range of oxygen isotopic compositions. Unlike the larger CAIs in Acfer 094, which are uniformly 16O-enriched, two of the three $\mu$CAIs we analyzed are isotopically normal. We also observed a Li-rich hotspot that detailed analysis by ToF-SIMS suggests may be a LiCr-oxide grain. Within the resolution of the NanoSIMS, this grain has isotopically normal Li. Finally, in our 50 × 50 $\mu$m area, we positively identified a presolar grain that is the most 18O-rich silicate found so far in meteorites. The grain may originate from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, or more likely, a supernova. In line with previous TEM studies (Greshake 1997), we find no evidence for clastic material (e.g., fragmental chondrules) in the matrix of Acfer 094: although the matrix is volatile-depleted, this depletion does not appear to result from dilution of a primordial starting material with (depleted) chondrule fragments. Assuming that matrix experienced the depletion event, our data on the detailed mineralogy of Acfer 094 are currently equivocal in constraining the nature of that event. We observe carrier phases for several elements consistent with conditions approaching equilibrium condensation; however, the presence of an amorphous groundmass is suggestive of more rapid cooling. {\textcopyright} The Meteoritical Society, 2007.},

abstract = {Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopic compositions are heterogeneous among comet 81P/Wild 2 particle fragments; however, extreme isotopic anomalies are rare, indicating that the comet is not a pristine aggregate of presolar materials. Nonterrestrial nitrogen and neon isotope ratios suggest that indigenous organic matter and highly volatile materials were successfully collected. Except for a single 17 O-enriched circumstellar stardust grain, silicate and oxide minerals have oxygen isotopic compositions consistent with solar system origin. One refractory grain is 16 O-enriched, like refractory inclusions in meteorites, suggesting that Wild 2 contains material formed at high temperature in the inner solar system and transported to the Kuiper belt before comet accretion.},

abstract = {Interstellar silicon carbide grains in meteorites provide a novel means for studying the carbon-star population of about 5 × 109 years ago. Their 12C/13C ratios differ greatly from the solar value but resemble those of present-day carbon stars, implying little change in the galactic 13C inventory. Isotope data on nitrogen and silicon suggest that the silicon carbide grains come mainly from red giants, with small contributions from novae. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Yang2015,
abstract = {Despite the significant improvement on spatial resolution, NanoSIMS still preserves relatively high mass resolution, sensitivity, and analytical precision. It has become an important analytical platform to determine chemical compositions of solid materials, and has been widely used in space, earth, life, and materials sciences, etc. By using a Cs+ ion beam with a size as small as 50 nm scanning over sample surfaces, we are able to obtain high spatial resolution images of up to 7 species simultaneously. When utilizing Faraday cup, high analytical precision of 0.3‰–0.5‰ (1SD) for C, O and S isotopic analysis can be achieved. Although this precision level is still lower than that of conventional SIMS, it already meets the major requirements of Earth Sciences. In 2011, the first NanoSIMS of China (Cameca NanoSIMS 50L) was installed at Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the working mechanism and analytical modes of the instrument, this paper will systematically introduce the analytical methods established with the NanoSIMS and their potential applications in earth sciences. These methods include trace element distribution images in mineral zoning, high spatial resolution (2–5 $\mu$m) Pb-Pb and U-Pb dating, water content and H isotopic analysis for silicate glass and apatite, C isotopic analysis for diamond and graphite, O isotopic analysis for carbonate, S isotopic analysis for sulfides. In addition, the specific requirements for sample preparation will also be introduced in order to facilitate domestic earth scientists' use.},
